Batchman
========

The batch processing service for (limited)data storage.

Install instructions:
---------------------
>If you can't use the command **xdg-open** on your system(like Windows) or you don't want to use a gui text editor, then edit the batchman server settings inside the src folder (***src***/***batchman.cfg***)
>Then run the setup install by follwing:
>
> `python setup.py install`

Else you can just execute de **init.sh** script, to open the default text editor for settings configuration and install the **batchman** package.

    sh init.sh

Now, you can enjoy the power of BATCHMAN!
